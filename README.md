# PATTENDS

# PROJECT made with (SQL, REACTJS, EXPRESS, NODEJS)

Pattends is a school attendance system designed to simplify and streamline the process of recording and managing student attendance. This system provides a user-friendly interface for teachers and school administrators to take attendance, view attendance records, and generate reports efficiently

Our motivation for creating Pattends was to address the challenges and inefficiencies we observed in managing school attendance. We wanted to simplify the attendance-taking process for teachers, improve communication with parents, and provide administrators with better tools for attendance record management. Ultimately, our goal was to enhance the overall educational experience by reducing administrative burdens.
